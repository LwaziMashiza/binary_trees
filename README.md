Binary_trees Project 

This project is about binary trees, in computer science, a binary tree is a tree data structure in which each node has at most two children, referred to as the left child and the right child. Upon completion of this project the follwoing objectives must be achieved:

1. What is a binary tree
2. What is the difference between a binary tree and a Binary Search Tree
3. What is the possible gain in terms of time complexity compared to linked lists
4. What are the depth, the height, the size of a binary tree
5. What are the different traversal methods to go through a binary tree
6. What is a complete, a full, a perfect, a balanced binary tree
